# odin-etch-a-sketch

Part of the odin project curriculum

- simply hover over the squares to create images.
- the default size is 16x16, but can be adjusted using the slider from a min of 4x4 to max 64x64.
- hovering over the same square removes the color on it.
- the colors are currently randomly generated.
- clear board button resets the board back to 16x16 and clears any image currently on board.
